    <h1>JavaScript Day 1 Interview Questions</h1>
    <p id="ques">Q1. Difference between "==" and "===" operators.</p>
    <h3>(==) Comparison Operator</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The JavaScript equals or loose equality operator ( == ) checks if two variables or values are equal. </li>
        <li>It returns true if two values are of equal value, even if they're of different types.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>(===) Comparison Operator</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true. </li>
        <li>if both the value and type of operands are the same.</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <p id="ques">Q2. What are the differences between var,let and const?</p>
    <h2>Var</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Var: Function-scoped, meaning it can be globally or locally scoped </li>
        <li>Var: Can be reassigned</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>let</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Let: Block-scoped, meaning it can only be used within the block it's declared</li>
        <li>Let: Can be reassigned, but not re-declared</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>const</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Const: Block-scoped, meaning it can only be used within the block it's declared</li>
        <li>Const: Cannot be reassigned or re-declared</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <p id="ques">Q3. What is execution context.</p>
    <h2>execution Context</h2>
    <p id="p1">A JavaScript execution context is a critical concept that defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. The execution context consists of two main components:</p>
    <hr>
    <p id="ques">Q4. What is creation Phase and execution phase.</p>
    <h2>Creation Phase</h2>
    <p id="p1">the "creation phase" refers to the initial stage where the JavaScript engine sets up the memory environment for a code block by allocating space for variables and functions</p>
    <p id="p1">the "execution phase" is when the actual code within that environment is run line by line, assigning values to variables and executing functions. </p>
    <hr>
    <p id="ques">Q5. What is hosting</p>
    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hoisting is a JavaScript feature that moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.  </li>
        <li>This allows you to use variables and functions before they are declared.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p id="ques">Q6. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</p>
    <h2>Undefined</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Undefined represents any value that has not been defined anywhere in the program. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>not defined</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>The JavaScript exception "variable is not defined" occurs when there is a non-existent variable referenced somewhere.</li>
     </ul>
    
    <h2>Nan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>NaN stands for Not a Number. You get this value when you try to do some operation that can't yield a meaningful result.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p id="ques">Q7. How many operators do we have in JS?</p>
    <p id="p1">JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables.<br> They are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions and can manipulate data in various ways.</p>
    <p id="p1">there are seven types operators: </p>
    
    <h2>1. Arithmetic Operators</h2>
    <p id="p1">Arithmetic Operators perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
        const sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
        const diff = 10 - 2; // Subtraction
        const p = 4 * 2; // Multiplication
        const q = 8 / 2; // Division
        console.log(sum, diff, p, q); 
    </pre>
    <p id="p1">+ adds two numbers.<br>
        â€“ subtracts the second number from the first.<br>
        * multiplies two numbers.<br>
        / divides the first number by the second.</p>
    <h3>Output: 8 8 8 4</h3>
    <h2>2. Assignment Operator</h2>
    <p id="p1">Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. <br>They can also perform operations like addition or multiplication before assigning the value.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <pre>
        let n = 10;
        n += 5;
        n *= 2;
        console.log(n);
    </pre>
    <h3>Output: 30</h3>
    <p id="p1">
       = assigns a value to a variable.<br>
       += adds and assigns the result to the variable.<br>
       *= multiplies and assigns the result to the variable
    </p>
    <h2>3. Comparison Operators</h2>
    <p id="p1">Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false).<br> They are useful for making decisions in conditional statements</p>
    <pre>
        console.log(10 > 5);
        console.log(10 === "10");
    </pre>
    <h3> Output: true, false</h3>
    <p id="p1">> checks if the left value is greater than the right.<br>
        === checks for strict equality (both type and value).<br>
        Other operators include <, <=, >=, and !==.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Logical Operators</h2>
    <p id="p1">Comparison operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values.</p>
    <pre>
        const a = true, b = false;<br>
        console.log(a && b); // Logical AND<br>
        console.log(a || b); // Logical OR

    </pre>
    <h3>Output:- false, true</h3>
    <p id="p1">&& returns true if both operands are true.<br>
        || returns true if at least one operand is true.<br>
        ! negates the boolean value.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Bitwise Operators</h2>
    <p id="p1">Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.</p>
    <pre>
        const res = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
        console.log(res);
    </pre>
    <h3>Output:- 1</h3>
    <p id="p1"> & performs a bitwise AND.<br>
        | performs a bitwise OR.<br>
        ^ performs a bitwise XOR.<br>
        ~ performs a bitwise NOT.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator</h2>
    <p id="p1">The ternary operator is a shorthand for conditional statements. It takes three operands.</p>
    <pre>
        const age = 18;
        const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
        console.log(status);
    </pre>
    <h3>Output:- Adult</h3>

    <h2>7. JavaScript Comma Operator</h2>
    <p>Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand.</p>
    <pre>
        let n1, n2
        const res = (n1 = 1, n2 = 2, n1 + n2);
        console.log(res);
    </pre>
    <h3>Output: 3</h3>
    <p>
        Each expression is evaluated from left to right.<br>
        The final result of the expression is the rightmost value

    <p id="ques">Q8.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope,Functional Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>Local or Function Scope:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables that are declared inside a function or a method have Local or Function Scope.</li>
        <li>It means those variables or functions which are declared inside the function or a method can be accessed within that function only.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Block Scope:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Block Scope is related to the variables or functions which are declared using let and const since var does not have block scope.</li>
        <li>Block Scope tells us that variables that are declared inside a block { }, can be accessed within that block only, not outside of that block.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scope Chain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript engine uses scopes to find out the exact location or accessibility of variables and that particular process is known as Scope Chain.</li>
        <li>Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).</li>
    </ul>
