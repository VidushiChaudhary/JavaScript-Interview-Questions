DAY2
<p>Q 1. What are objects in javascript?</p>
<p>
   An object in JavaScript is a data structure used to store related data collections.<br>
   It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the associated value.<br>
   Objects are dynamic, which means the properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.<br><br>
   There are two primary ways to create an object in JavaScript:<br>
   1. Object Literal <br>
   2. Object Constructor.<br>
</p>
<p>
   1. Creation Using Object Literal<br><br>
   The object literal syntax allows you to define and initialize an object with curly braces {}, setting properties as key-value pairs.<br>
</p>
<pre>
let obj = {
    name: "Sourav",
    age: 23,
    job: "Developer"
};
console.log(obj);
</pre>
<p>
2. Creation Using new Object() Constructor</p>
<pre>
let obj = new Object();
obj.name= "Sourav",
obj.age= 23,
obj.job= "Developer"
console.log(obj);
</pre>

<p>Q2. What are function?</p>
<p>
  Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks.<br> 
  They allow you to organize, reuse, and modularize code. It can take inputs, perform actions, and return outputs.</p>
<pre>
    function sum(x, y) { 
        return x + y; 
    }
    console.log(sum(6, 9))
</pre>
<p>Q3.  What is an event loop and call stack.</p>
<p>Event Loop: The event loop is a component of the JavaScript engine that manages the execution of code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
<p>The Event Loop checks whether the Call Stack is empty and, if so, pushes callbacks from the queue to the call stack.</p>
<p>The call stack is a crucial concept in JavaScript’s runtime environment, representing the mechanism by which the JavaScript engine keeps track of function calls in a program. It operates as a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last function called is the first one to be resolved.</p>
<pre>
    function f1() {
        console.log('Hi by f1!');
    }
    
    function f2() {
        f1();
        console.log('Hi by f2!');
    }
    
    f2();
    
</pre>
<p>What is the DOM?</p>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

    It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document 
    as objects. That way, languages like Javascript can connect to the page.
